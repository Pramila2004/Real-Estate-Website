                Hello! My name is <strong>Pramila Kolhe</strong>, and I am a passionate and dedicated student currently pursuing a 
                <strong> Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering</strong> at 
                <strong> D.Y. Patil College of Engineering, Akurdi</strong>. With a strong foundation in coding and a keen interest in
                problem-solving, I strive to excel in the field of software development and technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                I began my journey in technology during my diploma at 
                <strong> Government Polytechnic, Pune</strong>, where I secured an excellent academic record of 
                <strong> 91%</strong>. During my academic tenure, I explored a wide range of topics, from <strong>Data Structures</strong>  to <strong> Web Development</strong>, and became proficient in languages such as <strong>Python, C++, and Java</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                My projects range from building dynamic websites to solving real-world computational challenges, showcasing my ability to learn and adapt. I am currently honing my skills in web development and database management systems to create robust and user-friendly applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                Beyond academics, I am a meticulous and detail-oriented individual who values teamwork and collaboration. I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to innovative projects, and continuously expanding my knowledge base.
                </p>
                <p>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest trends in technology, enjoying books, or brainstorming ideas for new projects.
                </p>
                <p class="closing">
                I believe that the journey of learning never ends, and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as I work toward my dream of making a meaningful impact in the tech industry.
